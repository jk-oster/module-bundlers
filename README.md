This is a test and comparision between several build tools.

Starting with old school (and by now more or less deprecated) tools like Grunt & Gulp up to cutting edge Technologies like Vite, this is a trial to find the most comfortable one.

Addiditonally the more modern build tools that provide a dev server are set up within a docker container.
